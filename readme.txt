# Shodringer-s-Cat
This is a project that show the concept of duality in quantum mechanics by simple web page.

I have used css for desigining.
JScript for backend.
HTML for frontend.
The image files are in files folder.

How it works is that i generate a random number using "math.random()" function and then I multiply that number by "10" which gives me 
a number between 0-9 and then i use if statement-
if number is <=4 "Cat is alive"
If number is >4 and <=9 "Cat is dead"
This gives a 50/50 probability for bith cases.
